cascades-and-stackmob
=====================

Make StackMob work fine with BlackBerry Cascades in QML

All development is stopped. Why?

Unfortunately, StackMob has been acquired by PayPal, https://blog.stackmob.com/2013/12/stackmob-joins-paypal/ , meaning that now StackMob is dead. So bad, I liked StackMob a lot.
